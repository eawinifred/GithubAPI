# easygit
Project 1 at Andela Bootcamp
This was the first project we were asked to complete at the Andela Bootcamp for Class VII.

The task was to use the Github API to create a web application.

Easy Git
This web application can be found at http://eawinifred.github.io/easygit/
It allows you input your Github username to view your user data.

Find User Profile shows your Github profile info with number of followers, number of people you're following and the number of repositories on that account

List Repos allows shows your Github repos with direct links

List Repo Branches shows the Github branches in the repository specified by the user.

Go ahead, find that Gitthub information.


Upcoming Changes
Add Create Repo functionality
Add Delete Repo functionality
