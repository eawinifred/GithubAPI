# Easy Git
##### Project 1 at Andela Bootcamp

This was my first project at the Andela Class VII Bootcamp.

The task was to use the Github API to create a web application.

## Features
This web application can be found at http://eawinifred.github.io/easygit/
It allows you input your Github username to view your user data.

**Find User Profile** shows your Github profile info with number of followers, number of people you're following and the number of repositories on that account

**List Repos** allows shows your Github repos with direct links

**List Repo Branches** shows the Github branches in the repository specified by the user.

#  

#### Go ahead, find that Github information.


# Upcoming Changes
Easy Git will serve to bypass the Git Bash command line and perform basic repository manipulation in an attractive and easy to use web application.

The following changes will be added to V2
* Create Repo functionality
* Delete Repo functionality
